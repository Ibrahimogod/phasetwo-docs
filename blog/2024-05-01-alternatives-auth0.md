### Exploring Keycloak as an Alternative to Auth0 for Authentication Solutions

When it comes to implementing authentication and authorization in web applications, Auth0 and Keycloak are two prominent solutions that offer robust security features. While Auth0 is a popular choice for many developers due to its comprehensive, cloud-based platform, Keycloak presents a compelling alternative, especially in terms of cost and flexibility. This blog post will delve into how Keycloak stacks up against Auth0, focusing on cost of ownership, maintenance, and functionality.

#### Cost of Ownership

There are many factors to think about with a total cost-of-ownership. We've written extensively about [choosing an Open-Source IAM](./2024-03-11-open-source-iam.md) over a managed service.

**Auth0:**
Auth0 operates on a subscription model, which can be quite cost-effective for startups or small projects with minimal authentication needs. It offers a free tier limited by the number of authentications per month and features. Beyond this, prices increase based on the number of users and the level of features required. For large enterprises, this can translate into a significant ongoing expense.

**Keycloak:**
Keycloak, on the other hand, is an open-source solution developed by Red Hat. It is free to use, regardless of the number of users or the scale of the project. This makes Keycloak particularly attractive for businesses looking to cut costs or those who prefer not to be tied to vendor-specific pricing structures. The primary cost associated with Keycloak comes from the need to self-host and manage the software, which includes server costs and potential overhead for setup and maintenance.

#### Maintenance

**Auth0:**
One of the main advantages of Auth0 is that being a managed service, it requires minimal maintenance from the user's side. The Auth0 team handles updates, security patches, and infrastructure, ensuring that the system is kept up-to-date.

**Keycloak:**
Conversely, Keycloak requires more attention since it's self-hosted. Organizations must allocate resources for installing, configuring, and updating the software, as well as managing the underlying infrastructure. This can be a drawback for teams without the necessary technical expertise or resources. However, it also offers greater control over the deployment and security standards, which can be a significant advantage for certain regulatory environments.

#### Functionality and Flexibility

**Auth0:**
Auth0 offers a wide range of authentication features out-of-the-box, including social logins, enterprise federation, database connections, and more. It supports a variety of standards like OAuth2, OpenID Connect, and SAML, making it highly versatile for modern web applications. The platform also provides robust analytics and real-time monitoring tools that can be crucial for understanding user behavior and mitigating potential security threats.

**Keycloak:**
Keycloak matches Auth0 in terms of functionality, supporting similar authentication protocols and user federation. It also offers customizable user interfaces for login, registration, and account management, which can be tailored to match the specific needs of a business. Being open-source, Keycloak allows developers to modify the codebase and integrate with other systems more freely than Auth0, offering a higher degree of customization at the cost of additional developer effort.

#### Which one is best for me?

Choosing between Auth0 and Keycloak largely depends on your organizationâ€™s specific needs and capabilities. Auth0 is an excellent choice for those who need a hassle-free, fully managed solution with predictable costs linked to user numbers. However, for organizations that prioritize cost savings, have the capability to manage their infrastructure, or require extensive customization, Keycloak emerges as a powerful, budget-friendly alternative.

Both platforms offer extensive documentation and community support, which can help mitigate some of the challenges associated with implementation and maintenance. Ultimately, the decision should align with your business goals, technical capacity, and budget constraints.

Ultimately, we at Phase Two believe marrying the two together is the strongest match. We offer a robust [hosting options](https://phasetwo.io/) for multiple business sizes. This allows teams to take advantage of a managed service with the capability of an open-source package.
