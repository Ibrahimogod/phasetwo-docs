# Keycloak: An open source alternative to Auth0, WorkOS, Okta, Cognito, ...

In today's digital landscape, managing user identities and securing access to applications and services is paramount for businesses of all sizes. As the demand for robust identity and access management (IAM) solutions grows, so does the market, with various commercial options vying for attention. When I first started using Keycloak over 7 years ago, I was surprised that there was a relatively unknown, but complete open source alternative to commercial offerings in the Identity and Access Management market. 


Companies such as Auth0, Okta, Microsoft (through AzureAD) had created cloud authentication services, and helped bring standardization to the market through implementation of standards, such as OIDC, SAML, SCIM, LDAP, etc. However, there was little differentiation among them, and despite their pricing models, were essentially commodities that were the same.


Amazon released AWS Cognito, which did price it as a commodity, but failed so miserably in UI and developer ergonomics, that it failed to reach a dominant market position despite its de minimis cost.


More recently, nascent companies such as WorkOS and Frontegg, while casting themselves as CIAM and “SSO made easy” to enterprise SaaS customers, are really just repackaging the same IAM features and protocol implementations that have been available in Keycloak for years. Furthermore, the pricing models have tilted back towards predatory on your company’s business model.


However, amidst this landscape, open-source alternatives like Keycloak are emerging as powerful contenders, offering unique advantages over their commercial counterparts. Keycloak stands out as an alternative to commercial IAM solutions, enabling your business to unlock both flexibility and control. 


**1. Open Source Foundation:**


At the heart of Keycloak lies its open-source nature. Developed by Red Hat, Keycloak provides a fully-fledged IAM solution that is freely available for anyone to use, modify, and extend according to their requirements. This open ethos empowers organizations with unparalleled flexibility and control over their identity infrastructure, without being tied to proprietary vendors or licensing agreements.


**2. Cost-Effectiveness:**


One of the most significant advantages of Keycloak is its cost-effectiveness. Unlike commercial IAM solutions that operate on subscription-based pricing models, Keycloak eliminates licensing fees, enabling organizations to allocate resources more efficiently. With Keycloak, businesses can scale their identity infrastructure without worrying about escalating costs, making it an attractive option for startups, small businesses, and enterprises alike.


**3. Customization and Extensibility:**


Keycloak stands out for its robust customization and extensibility capabilities. From authentication flows and user federation to role-based access control (RBAC) and fine-grained permissions, Keycloak provides a plethora of features that can be tailored to suit specific use cases and compliance requirements. Moreover, its modular architecture and comprehensive API support facilitate seamless integration with existing systems and third-party services, empowering developers to build bespoke identity solutions with ease.


**4. On-Premises and Cloud Deployment:**


Whether organizations prefer on-premises deployment for enhanced security and compliance or cloud-based solutions for scalability and convenience, Keycloak offers the flexibility to meet diverse deployment needs. With support for Docker, Kubernetes, and other containerization technologies, Keycloak simplifies deployment across various environments, ensuring seamless integration into existing infrastructure and workflows.


**5. Active Community and Support:**


Backed by a vibrant community of developers and contributors, Keycloak benefits from ongoing enhancements, bug fixes, and feature additions. This active ecosystem fosters innovation and collaboration, with users sharing best practices, troubleshooting tips, and extensions through forums, mailing lists, and code repositories. Additionally, organizations seeking professional support and services can leverage expertise of a growing ecosystem of companies providing support, ensuring reliable deployment and ongoing maintenance of their Keycloak instances.


In a landscape dominated by commercial IAM solutions, Keycloak shines as a compelling alternative that combines the power of open source with enterprise-grade features and flexibility. With its cost-effectiveness, customization capabilities, deployment flexibility, and active community support, Keycloak empowers organizations to take control of their identity infrastructure, unlock new possibilities, and adapt to evolving security and compliance requirements. Whether you're a startup looking to bootstrap your identity management or an enterprise seeking to streamline operations, Keycloak offers a compelling solution that puts you in the driver's seat of your IAM journey.
