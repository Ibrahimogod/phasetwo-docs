title: User Migration
---

User migration is an optional feature that can be installed in your realm by request. Customers who have legacy user databases they wish to import can use this feature as part of initial or ongoing migration to Phase Two. We use a variant of this [Keycloak user migration extension](https://github.com/daniel-frak/keycloak-user-migration).
