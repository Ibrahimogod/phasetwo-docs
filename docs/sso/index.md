title: SSO
---

SSO enables authentication via an organizationâ€™s Identity Provider (IdP), such as Google Workspace or Okta instead of managing usernames and passwords. Phase Two implementations of IdP connections support [SAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Assertion_Markup_Language) and [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/) standard protocols.

You can add and manage IdP connections through the Admin UI under the "Identity Providers" section. Documentation for the administration of IdPs can be found in the [Keycloak server adminstration](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#_identity_broker) docs.

If you have enabled the Organization customer portal, or are using the Phase Two Connect onboarding wizards, your customers can manage their IdP connections on their own.
