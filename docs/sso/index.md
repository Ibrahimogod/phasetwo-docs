title: SSO
---

SSO enables authentication via an organizationâ€™s Identity Provider (IdP), such as Google Workspace or Okta instead of managing usernames and passwords. Phase Two implementations of IdP connections support [SAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Assertion_Markup_Language) and [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/) standard protocols.

You can add and manage IdP connections through the Admin UI under the "Identity Providers" section.

If you have enabled the Organization customer portal, or are using the Phase Two Connect onboarding wizards, your customers can manage their IdP connections on their own.
