Phase Two Connect is currently available by invitation only. [Contact us](mailto:support@phasetwo.io) for more information.

Phase Two Connect solves one of the top issues with on-prem software installation and onboarding: connecting the customer identity provider. It allows the vendor to implement a simple, standard interface, giving them access to an extensive catalog of identity provider support, with guided onboarding wizards for the customer.

If your software is currently secured using Keycloak, Phase Two or another OIDC method, updating it to use Phase Two Connect is a quick integration that will give you significant automation to one of the most time-consuming aspects of on-prem software customer onboarding.

See a short video demonstrating how the Phase Two Connect "wizards" streamline IdP setup:
