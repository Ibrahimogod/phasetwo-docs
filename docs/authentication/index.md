title: Authentication
---

Authentication refers to how your users will securely identify themselves to your application. It is also a complex topic, as each application will have its own requirements. There will be several important topics to understand so that you can configure your authentication flows to fit your needs.

### Testing

If you have not already, it is important to set up a test application such as the `debug-app` described in the [Getting started](/docs/getting-started) section. This will provide a mechanism to view and debug your authentication flows, validate that the desired user experience is correct, and the information you want passed to the application is present.

### Authentication topics

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
