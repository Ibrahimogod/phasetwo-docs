Webhooks give application developers the ability to listen for all audit events using an HTTP endpoint. Events are sent to your endpoint using the same format as they are submitted in the audit API.

## Managing webhook subscriptions

Webhooks are managed with a custom REST resource with the following methods. Use of these methods requires the authenticated user to have the `view-events` and `manage-events` permissions.

| Path | Method | Payload | Returns | Description |
| ---- | ------ | ------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `/auth/realms/:realm/webhooks` | `GET` | | List of webhook objects | Get webhooks |
| `/auth/realms/:realm/webhooks` | `POST` | Webhook object | `201` | Create webhook |
| `/auth/realms/:realm/webhooks/:id` | `GET` | | Webhook object | Get webhook |
| `/auth/realms/:realm/webhooks/:id` | `PUT` | Webhook object | `204` | Update webhook |
| `/auth/realms/:realm/webhooks/:id` | `DELETE` | Webhook object | `204` | Delete webhook |

The webhook object has this format:
```json
{
  "id": "475cd2fd-3ca8-4c22-b5c8-c8b8927dcc10",
  "enabled": "true",
  "url": "https://example.com/some/webhook",
  "secret": "ofj09saP4",
  "eventTypes": [
    "*"
  ],
  "createdBy": "ff730b72-a421-4f6e-9e4e-7fc7f53bac88",
  "createdAt": "2021-04-21T18:25:43-05:00"
}
```	

For creating and updating of webhooks, `id`, `createdBy` and `createdAt` are ignored. `secret` is not sent when fetching webhooks.

## Retries

Webhooks are sent using an automatic exponential backoff if there is not a 2xx response. The sending tasks are scheduled after the transaction which produced the event has been committed, so there is no question if the activity has occured. 

## Example

To create a webhook for all events on the `test` realm:

```
POST /auth/realms/test/webhooks

{
  "enabled": "true",
  "url": "https://exxxxxxxxxxxxxx.m.pipedream.net",
  "secret": "A3jt6D8lz",
  "eventTypes": [
    "*"
  ]
}
```

## Testing
[Pipedream](https://pipedream.com/) is a great way to test your webhooks, and use the data to integrate with your other applications.
