This section is indended as a quickstart for the impatient, the experienced, or both. There are a world of options between Keycloak itself and the Phase Two extensions, and this section does not attempt to do anything but scratch the surface. Busy developers want quick validation for proofs-of-concept, and this should get you there quickly.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
